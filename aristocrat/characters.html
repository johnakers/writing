        <h4>Notes on notable characters during Rhys' journal</h4>
        <h5>Baron Quade Haley</h5>
        <p>Quade is a "Robber" Baron of West Gristol. Quade's father, Jerrah, and a few others founded a trading company. Once the Haleys bought out the others, Jerrah and his son used unscrupulous methods to become the number one trading company throughout the Isles.</p>
        <p>Quade does not care much for his son. Resenting him for the death of his wife during childbirth, he sends Rhys to boarding schools his entire life, away from Baleton. As he ages, he realizes that his sole heir, Rhys, will take over his empire of shipping fleets and ensures his safety with Orel.</p>
        <h5>Inspirational Characters</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Daniel Plainview</li>
          <li>Cornelius Vanderbilt</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Rhys Danilo "R.D." Haley</h5>
        <p>Rhys is the son of Quade Haley. Effectively raised by caretakers, handmaids and school staff until going to The Roat Institute at age 18.</p>
        <p>He has been taking fencing classes since the age of 12, using a rapier. He's been sailing since the age of 14. At 18, he took up feathery, a bat and ball sport, casually.</p>
        <p>Rhys is an above average student at The Roat Institute.</p>

        <h5>Marko "Orel" Orlov</h5>
        <p>Marko became a "Soot" at an early age. The Soots are a gang in Tyvia specializing in racketeering, assasinations and intimidation. He acted as a chimney sweep, stealing valuables from the high end districts of Dabovka. He took on his first assasination at 13. Learning to use his unique knife, Marko became the number one assasin in Tyvia. His only policy was, "no children".</p>
        <p>He was told to assassinate a visiting aristocrat from Dunwall. He did, or so he thought. He assassinated the wrong person, a High Judge of Tyvia set to meet the aristocrat. With Operators after him and the entire state Tyvia plastering his face on wanted posters in any port city, he went into hiding. He hid long enough to get a chance meeting with Quade Haley via a captain in the HMC, Dade Yorston, who instead of turning him over... decided to use his services to remove rivals of the HMC.</p>
        <p>Changing his name to "Orel", he's worked for the Haley family since, doing corporate espionage and other tasks. As time went on he became the head of security for the Haley docks in Baleton and then became the personal guard of R.D. Haley.</p>

        <h5>Charlotte Ashwell / Sofia Olaskir</h5>
        <p>Charlotte (Sofia) was born to Larisa Olaskir, in Dunwall, in secret. Her father is unknown but presumed to be someone not of noble birth but close to the Empress, such as a tailor, or servant. At the age of 10, Charlotte was told her real name and heritage by the Empress. She was cared for by a family in the Estate District who also know her real past. She is introduced to everyone as a distant relative.</p>
        <p>With tensions rising in Morley, at the end of the 18th century, the Empress advised Charlotte's caretaker family to leave not only Dunwall, but Gristol itself south to Serkonos, where the caretaker's family has family businesses.</p>
        <p>She is in Baleton for approximately a year, while the caretaker family is incrementally given money by the Empress, without raising too much suspiscion.</p>
