  <h1>Aristocrat</h1>

  <p>"Aristocrat" is a story set in the city of <a href="http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Baleton">Baleton</a>
  before the events of the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishonored">Dishonored</a>, surrounding Rhys Haley.</p>

  <p>Rhys is a university-aged young man who comes from a notorious and wealthy family, particularly
  in the west coast city of Gristol. He meets a young woman, who is not who she says she is, and
  Rhys must decide what to do and how to resolve a situation that he cannot remove himself out of.

  <p>Parts of these documents will not make sense to those that are not familiar with the world of
  Dishonored. For that, not only do I suggest playing the Dishonored games and reading the comics
  and short novels but also using the <a href="http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Dishonored_Wiki">
  Dishonored Wiki</a> as a guide for parts that were unknown.</p>

  <p>I've taken some liberties with Baleton and its overall image, planning and history. It, aside
  from <a href="http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Businesses#Hemlock_from_Baleton">Hemlock</a>, and
  being mentioned in short novels of the Dishonored timeline very briefly, is more or less unknown
  in the world of Dishonored. The same for <a href="http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Potterstead">
  Pottershead</a>, <a href="http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Driscol">Driscol</a> and other cities
  throughout the Isles.</p>

  <p>I've imagined Baleton as a small fishing city that became a prominent trading port during the
  pre-whale oil days of the Isles, just before
  <a href="http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Esmond_Roseburrow">Esmond Roseburrow</a>'s creations and 
  discoveries. Once whale oil came about, more powerful ships and technology arose, Baleton returned from the trading port it once was back to a small fishing village, only
  seeing more exposure during the days of the rat plague of Dunwall as a safe haven.</p>
